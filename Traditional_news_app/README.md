In this web application built using Django, we intend to develop an application which uses the traditional news fetching techniques. 
Here we have used https://newsapi.org so that later we could compare our new application with it.

To use this Application in your local system type the following commands in the terminal:

1. git clone [repo-name]
2. create a virtual environment
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. python manage.py migrate
5. python manage.py runserver
